# CAR PRICE PREDICTION
* Carried out pre-processing and visualization of both categorical and numerical data
* Prediction of price done by using linear regression model
* Made a web-App using streamlit that allows you to control the parameters that affect the price of the car, allowing the model to predict the price at different
  values of attributes 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
