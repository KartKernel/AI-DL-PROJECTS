### Falcon-7b-instruct
Falcon-7B is a strong base model, outperforming comparable open-source models (e.g., MPT-7B, StableLM, RedPajama etc.), thanks to being trained on 1,500B tokens of RefinedWeb enhanced with curated corpora.

Falcon-7B-Instruct is a 7B parameters causal decoder-only model built by TII based on Falcon-7B and finetuned on a mixture of chat/instruct datasets. It is made available under the Apache 2.0 license.
